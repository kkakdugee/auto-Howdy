Automate logins for Texas A&M's 'Howdy' Student Portal using [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/) and [Chromium](https://github.com/chromium/chromium)

- still working on a workaround for 2FA.
- download the **Chromium** binaries **[here](https://download-chromium.appspot.com/)** (For Windows) and extract the zip file into your cloned repo.
